"Preliminary evaluation of the influence of the temperature on the performance of a piezoresistive pressure sensor based on a-SiC film","Thin Film and Devices","Piezoresistive Pressure Sensor","PECVD (plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition)","Amorphous","The use of silicon carbide films as piezoresistors in a pressure sensor for high temperature application","2011","thermally oxidized (100) Si","The sensor was tested for applied pressure ranging from 0 to 12 psi and supply voltage of 12 V. The resistance of each piezoresistor was measured incrementally from room temperature upto 300°C. "
"Influence of SiC thin films thickness on the electrical properties of Pd/SiC thin films for hydrogen gas sensor","Thin Film and Devices","Hydrogen Gas Sensor","RF-magnetron sputtering technique","Amorphous","The use of silicon carbide thin films in hydrogen gas sensor","2020"," (100) Si","The hydrogenation of the Pd/SiC thin films was carried out in a fixed hydrogen ambient (2 bar) at room temperature and 250 ◦C. The dehydrogenation of these samples was also carried out in the same chamber at room temperature and 250 ◦C in the absence of hydrogen gas under low vacuum (10− 3 torr)."
