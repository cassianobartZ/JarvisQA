"Ultrafast Dynamic Piezoresistive Response of Graphene-Based Cellular Elastomers","< 2","0.082"," A typical synthesis procedure for G-elastomer was used. Graphene oxide (GO) solution was mixed with ascorbic acid , which was then placed in a boiling water bath for 30 min to partially reduce the GO. The vial was
then immersed in a dry ice bath to freeze. After being thawed at
room temperature, the vial was placed in the boiling water bath again to
further reduce GO. The obtained graphene hydrogel was
then subjected to dialysis, freeze drying and thermal annealing. The G-elastomers with different densities were prepared
using the same procedure but with different concentrations of GO.","Performance of emerging piezoresistive materials in flexible sensor applications","Advanced Materials"," ultralow pressure detection,  soft and elastic materials, electromechanical

"3D hybrid porous Mxene-sponge network and its application in piezoresistive sensor","< 5.37","9","The pressure sensor was fabricate by fixing MXene-sponge onto
the interdigital electrode that pre-deposited PVA NWs networks, then it
was fixed and packaged with a plastic film to ensure conformal contact
of MXene-sponge and interdigitated electrodes. After that, two copper
wires were connected to the two ends of the interdigitated electrodes
through the silver paste to establish external contacts. Finally, a layer of
PDMS was coated on it as the fixation.","Performance of emerging piezoresistive materials in flexible sensor applications","Nano Energy","PVA nanowires, pressure sensor, sponge , MXene","MXene","Human physiology detection","Flexible Sensors","138","147","2018"

constructed with two layers of as-prepared micro-patterned SWNTs/PDMS conducting films. One side of a conducting film was placed with Ag paste to form an electrode. After Ag paste dried, two SWNTs/PDMS conducting films were overlapped together with patterned surfaces touching each other (Ag electrode not touching the surface of the other film). Finally the edges of the device were bonded with Kapton tape to form the flexible E-skin device.

"Highly Stretchable Resistive Pressure Sensors Using a Conductive Elastomeric Composite on a Micropyramid Array","< 0.8","23","The PDMS elastomer and
its cross-linker were mixed and then degassed under
vacuum. The mixture was cast onto a poly(urethane acrylate) (PUA) pyramid-patterned replica, with spacers used to define the thickness. After a thermal curing process, a PDMS film inked with a pyramid array pattern was peeled off from the PUA replica. The micropatterned PDMS substrate was cleaned with pressure adhesive tapes (e.g., Scotch tape) and then pretreated with UV
ozone. A polymer blend solution was then
drop-casted onto the PDMS, and the excess solution was drained away by
holding the substrate vertically before annealing.","Performance of emerging piezoresistive materials in flexible sensor applications","Advanced Materials","PDMS, micropyramid array, conductive elastomeric composite, resistive pressure sensors ","Conductive elastomeric

"A wearable and highly sensitive pressure sensor with ultrathin gold nanowires","from 0 to 50","13","Tissue papers were dipped into a chloroform solution of the AuNWs. After evaporating the chloroform, the colour of tissue paper changed from white to dark red. Then the dip-coating and drying process were repeated until the electrical resistance of paper sheets be reached. The Ti/Au interdigitated electrodes were deposited onto PDMS substrates  using a designed shadow mask by an electric beam evaporator.  Two contact pads were deposited at the two ends of the interdigitated electrodes to establish external contacts. Then, the bottom layer electrode coated PDMS and upper layer blank PDMS supports were treated by thin oxygen plasma and permanently sealed outside the AuNWs coated tissue paper to ensure conformal contact of tissue paper and interdigitated electrodes.","Performance of emerging piezoresistive materials in flexible sensor applications","

"Highly Sensitive, Transparent, and Durable Pressure Sensors Based on Sea-Urchin Shaped Metal Nanoparticles","< 11","","To fabricate SSNPs-PU composites with different concentrations of the SSNPs, various amounts of the SSNPs in chloroform were mixed with 
polyurethane resin to obtain a SSNPs/PU solution. Then, chloroform in the SSNPs/PU solution was removed
using a rotary evaporator at room temperature. PU hardener was added into the SSNPs-PU solution for polymerization. Then, the SSNPs-PU mix mixture was stirred and spin-coated onto an ITO coated PET substrate to obtain a SSNPs-PU/ITO film. Another ITO coated PET substrate was put onto the SSNPs-PU/ITO film to make a sandwiched structure of ITO/SSNPs-PU/ITO pressure sensor.","Performance of emerging piezoresistive materials in flexible sensor applications","Advanced Materials","finger-pressure sensing, metal nanoparticles, high sensitivity, pressure sensors","Metal Nanoparticles","Finger motion","Flexible Sensors","30","2.46","2016"
